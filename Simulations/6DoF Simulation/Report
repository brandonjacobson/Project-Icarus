#6-DoF Quadcopter Simulation Notes
## -------Current Project--------

## Description
This simulation models a quadcopter drone using an animated Python graph to visualize movement in a 3D space. The quadcopter flies using waypoints, controlled by multiple
PID controllers to control attitude, altitude, and motor thrust. 

## Progress:
The current state of the simulation allows for waypoint flying, and the quadcopter settles within 3 seconds for targets within 5 meters, with slight growing oscillations
occuring at targets of 5 meters or farther. Reasoning for this could either be the tuning of the PID controllers not necessarily agreeing in each cascading step, or a fundamental
problem with the control of attitude. Additionally, when navigating between multiple waypoints, the oscillations grow rapidly and the quadcopter fails to settle after traveling
10m+. This might be fixed by a change in attitude control. The Euler angle usage should not be a problem, but more an issue with the agreeement between attitude of the drone
and motor thrust control.

## Goal:
The goal of this project is to create a test platform for autonomous functions of the Icarus quadcopter. When this simulation is complete, I can design missions for Icarus
and directly apply them to the hardware. This platform is also an exercise in understanding the dynamics and control of the quadcopter, as before this project I had a limited
understanding of Euler angles, 3-dimensional dynamics, and cascading control schemes.
